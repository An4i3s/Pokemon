# Pokemon

I made a simple text-based program in Java that simulates the Pokemon GamePlay.

The User gets to choose a starter Pokemon and then gets to fight and catch other pokemons.

I built this project to practice Java concepts such as abstract classes and interfaces.

## To Do:
1. Add all the original Pokemons
2. Implement a Travel method that let you visit places
4. Create a method spcifically to catch Pokemons
5. Handle incorrect user input
6. Create a method to learn moves + create moves class/objects
